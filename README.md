MapPy
=====

This is a python module designed for taking GPS coordinates and making them into a movie. This is only available for Python 2.7 as of now.


Downloads
=========

In order to be able to run the conversions from the map images to movies, please download [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php). 
And note that if you want to be able to create a .mov file rather than a .gif, you must also have FFmpeg installed.

Coming Soon
===========

I am going to be changing the code so that it is made up of 2 classes, Map and Analyze. Everything given already is the Map class, and Analyze will be methods of analyzing the GPS data. Two functions that will be available in the Analyze class are a home finder and movement watcher.

Documentation
=============

The full documentation is available above, but here is a snipit of how to use it.
